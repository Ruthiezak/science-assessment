    "Please provide the URL to the GitHub repository where your workshop material is: [Workshop Material](https://github.com/Ruthiezak/Workshop-Material) \n",
    "\n",
    "Please ***briefly*** explain how you would teach each concept you proposed in your workshop material, think about what common mistakes and questions that beginners have. Also, consider the case when students ask you a question you don't have the answer to, and how you would respond."
    "In programming, there are two types of functions built-in functions and user-defined functions. They perform certain steps to give a particular output. I'll first explain what built-in functions are using an example. In Python, there are ready-made functions called max() and min(). Let's use numbers for this example. If you put in a list of numbers within the parenthesis of these functions separated by commas and click enter, they will each give you the maximum and minimum value of the list of numbers that you input! You (the user) can also write your own functions which are called user-defined functions. For example, you want to have a function that gives the second-highest number from a list of numbers as the output. For this, you can define what you'd like your function name to be (example: secondmax()) and write the relevant code (which is more complex) which will give the desired output.\n"
    "Some common mistakes that beginners may have can be regarding the keyword global. It takes a while to understand that though global variables can be accessed anywhere in the program, they cannot be updated within the function. The use of the keyword global helps to updat the variables even within the function.\n"
    "If a student has a question that I cannot answer, I would try to find alternate resources that the student can use to understabd that concept better. Further, I would direct that student to the senior members of the committee who would likely have more experience and an answer tot he query that the student has.\n"
